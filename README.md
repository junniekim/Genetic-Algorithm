# genetic-algorithm

This program demonstrate genetic algorithm in Java to provide (hopefully but not guaranteed) good solution to Traveling Salesperson problem, where the salesman wants to travel all given cities with the minimal distance.

The total distance is calculated based on the distance on xy coordinates as each city's location is given in x and y coordinates. Then it goes through the phases of natural selection, which include 
reproduction, crossover, and mutation. The following code provide its answer based on 100,000th generation.
